Day 1

Journal Entry - Maria

It's funny how the universe sends you signs. During my meditation, it hit me - I've spent years as a leaf in the wind, blowing wherever life took me. There's beauty in that, sure, but there's a void too, a sense of something lacking. I've spent so much time enjoying the moment without truly considering the future. The partying, the weed, the mdma, all the moments that felt freeing but chained me in the long run.

Today, I opened up my computer and started a coding lesson. I'd been putting it off forever. I got through an hour, which isn't a lot, but it's a start. My hands felt more at home holding a paintbrush, but the thought of securing a stable future and that dream beach house kept me going. I imagined the sound of waves crashing, my future kids playing in the sand... I want that life.

Day 2

Fell back into old habits today. Jess called, and we went out. I know, I shouldn’t have. It felt like escapism, just as my art used to feel. I love painting, but lately, it's been more about paying the bills than genuine expression. Still, I'm grateful it provides for me. I need to find another job alongside, maybe something flexible. Tomorrow, I'll search for opportunities.

I need to remember my visions and not just live for the present. The present is a gift, but the future is a masterpiece waiting to be painted.

Today was a mix. Started my morning cleaning the apartment, which felt therapeutic. There's something about a clean space that makes the mind clearer too. I got in another coding lesson and surprisingly, it felt easier.

Went to a park in the afternoon, grounded myself, tried to connect more spiritually with the earth. Sat barefoot on the grass, closed my eyes, and visualized my future. The family, the beach house, the spiritual connection. It felt more tangible than ever.

Day 4

I received an email about a part-time job today. It’s at a local bookstore. It might not be the SWE job I aspire to, but it's a step, a change. The interview is next week, fingers crossed.

My artwork felt inspired today. Perhaps it's because I'm trying to evolve, to become more, or maybe it's the cleaner environment. There’s a piece I'm working on that reflects my journey, the chaos, the peace, the old me, and the emerging one.

Day 5

Spent the day reflecting and reading. I picked up a book on instant gratification and how it affects our lives. It’s enlightening to see how much I seek quick rewards, from partying to mindlessly scrolling on social media.

I need to focus on the bigger picture. To truly change, to become more connected, grounded, and achieve my dreams. It won't be easy, breaking old habits and forming new ones, but I'm hopeful. For now, small steps every day will do.
