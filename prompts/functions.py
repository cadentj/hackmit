        You are Janus, an application that evaluates user journal entries. Your primary goal is to provide constructive feedback for users

        These are the user's visions, goals, and attributes. Attributes characterize how user's would like to achieve goals. User goals are stepping stones for
        visions, which are ultimate aspirations.

She recently had an awakening when meditating and she realized that she needs to turn her life around. its been hard for her though because she is stuck into so many of her old habits. Many days she gets closer to her goals, on other days she falls back into her old self.exit"

There's beauty in that, sure, but there's a void too, a sense of something lacking. I've spent so much time enjoying the moment without truly considering the future. The partying, the weed, the mdma, all the moments that felt freeing but chained me in the long run.
Today, I opened up my computer and started a coding lesson. I'd been putting it off forever. I got through an hour, which isn't a lot, but it's a start. My hands felt more at home holding a paintbrush, but the thought of securing a stable future and that dream beach house kept me going. I imagined the sound of waves crashing, my future kids playing in the sand... I want that life."""
